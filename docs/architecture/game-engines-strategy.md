# Game Engines Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for implementing multiple game engines within the Tablium platform. The platform will support various classic board and tile games, starting with Dominoes and expanding to Chess, Draughts (Checkers), and Go, with potential for more games in the future.

## Strategy Goals
1. Create a family of game engines with shared architectural patterns
2. Enable code reuse across game engines where possible
3. Maintain game-specific logic separation
4. Ensure consistent integration with platform services
5. Support seamless user experience across games

## Game Engine Family
The initial implementation will include the following game engines:

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
1. **Dominoes Game Engine** (P0)
   - Core dominoes gameplay
   - Multiple variants (Draw, Block, All Fives, etc.)
   - Foundation for the platform

### Phase 2: Expansion
2. **Chess Game Engine** (P1)
   - Standard chess rules
   - Multiple variants (Standard, Chess960, etc.)
   - Notation support (PGN, FEN)

3. **Draughts Game Engine** (P1)
   - Multiple variants (International, American, etc.)
   - Various board sizes (8x8, 10x10)
   - Notation support (PDN)

4. **Go Game Engine** (P1)
   - Multiple rulesets (Chinese, Japanese, etc.)
   - Various board sizes (9x9, 13x13, 19x19)
   - Notation support (SGF)

### Future Phases
5. **Additional Game Engines** (P2)
   - Backgammon
   - Card games (Poker, Bridge, etc.)
   - Other classic board games

## Shared Architecture
All game engines will share a common architectural approach:

1. **Core Components**
   - Game state representation
   - Move validation
   - Game progression logic
   - Rule enforcement
   - Result determination

2. **Common Interfaces**
   - Game initialization
   - Move application
   - State validation
   - Game completion
   - Serialization/deserialization

3. **Integration Points**
   - Game state persistence
   - Realtime updates
   - Tournament integration
   - User statistics
   - Blockchain verification

## Implementation Approach
1. **Base Engine Framework**
   - Create shared utilities and patterns
   - Define common interfaces
   - Implement base classes for reuse

2. **Game-Specific Implementation**
   - Implement game-specific logic
   - Define rule variations
   - Create specialized state managers

3. **Integration Layer**
   - Connect engines to platform services
   - Implement common APIs across games
   - Create unified event system

## Development Priorities
1. Complete the Dominoes Game Engine first (P0)
2. Extract common patterns into shared libraries
3. Implement Chess, Draughts, and Go engines in parallel (P1)
4. Create comprehensive test suites for each engine
5. Develop integrated examples with platform services

## Technical Considerations
- Use TypeScript for all implementations
- Follow immutable data patterns for game state
- Implement comprehensive validation
- Create detailed event logging
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous play
- Enable AI support for all games
- Optimize for performance and scalability

## Future Expansion
This strategy allows for expanding the platform with new games by:
1. Following established patterns
2. Reusing common components
3. Implementing game-specific logic
4. Integrating with existing platform services

Each new game engine can be developed independently while maintaining consistency with the platform, creating a rich ecosystem of classic games on the Tablium platform.
