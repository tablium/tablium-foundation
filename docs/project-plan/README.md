# Tablium Project Plan

This document outlines the complete project plan for the Tablium Dominoes platform, divided into four main phases. Each phase has its own priorities and acceptance criteria to ensure a successful MVP launch.

## Project Overview

Tablium is a blockchain-based Dominoes platform that combines traditional Dominoes gameplay with modern blockchain technology. The platform includes features for multiple Dominoes variants (Mexican Train, Cuban Dominoes, Block Dominoes), tournaments, social interactions, and comprehensive analytics.

## Task Documentation Standards

All task documentation should follow these standards to ensure clarity and alignment with the system architecture:

### Architecture References

Each task should include an "Architecture Context" section that explains:
1. Where the component fits in the overall system architecture
2. How it interacts with other components
3. Which architectural patterns it implements
4. Any specific technical considerations related to the architecture

Example:
```
## Architecture Context
This component is part of the Core Game Services layer in the backend architecture. It implements the primary game logic that powers all Dominoes variants on the platform. The Game Engine:
- Sits at the center of the game processing pipeline
- Interfaces with the Game State Persistence service for saving and loading game states
- Provides game state data to the Real-time Game Updates service
- Follows a microservices architecture pattern with well-defined interfaces
```

### Acceptance Criteria Structure

Acceptance criteria should be structured in a hierarchical manner:
1. Top-level criteria (numbered)
2. Sub-criteria with specific implementation details (bulleted)

This structure helps developers understand both the high-level requirements and specific implementation details.

### Technical Notes

Technical notes should include:
- Technology stack requirements
- Architectural patterns to be used
- Performance considerations
- Security requirements
- Testing approaches

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Backend Development
- Core infrastructure setup
- Core services implementation
- Game services development

- Game interface
- Wallet & transactions
- Social features
- Testing & optimization

### Phase 4: Integration and Deployment
- System integration
- Testing & quality assurance
- Deployment
- Monitoring & maintenance
- Documentation & training
